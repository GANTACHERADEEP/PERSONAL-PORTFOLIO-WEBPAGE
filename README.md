## Project Description: Developer Portfolio Website
As part of my internship at CodTech, I was assigned Task-3, which involved designing and building a basic portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The goal of the task was to create a single-page responsive website that showcases a developerâ€™s profile, projects, and contact information. This task allowed me to apply my fundamental front-end development skills and practice building an interface from scratch without relying on any pre-built frameworks like Bootstrap.

# Tools and Technologies Used
To complete this project, I used:

HTML5 for creating the structure of the webpage.

CSS3 for styling and responsiveness.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) as my primary code editor.

A web browser (Chrome) for testing the design across different screen sizes.

I kept the development process simple and focused entirely on core web technologies to better understand layout design, responsiveness, and interactivity using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

# Project Structure
The website is split into two files:

index.html: Contains all the content and markup of the site.

style.css: Contains all the styling rules to make the layout look visually appealing and responsive.

Additionally, I included a personal image (cheradeep.jpg) to visually represent the developer on the homepage.

ðŸ§© Key Sections Implemented
Navigation Bar:
A simple and clean navigation bar sits at the top of the page, containing buttons like Home, About, Projects, and Contact. Each button is interactive and toggles between sections dynamically using JavaScript.

Home Section:
This section contains the developerâ€™s profile picture and a brief introduction. The image is positioned at the top with the text content (name, role, and intro message) placed just below it. The layout adjusts dynamically on smaller screens to ensure mobile responsiveness.

About Section:
This section provides a short paragraph about me â€” a B.Tech student with a keen interest in frontend development, especially with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Projects Section:
I highlighted two key projects here:

A Real-Time Chat App built using React and WebSockets.

A Quiz App built in JavaScript that provides instant feedback.

Each project is enclosed in a "card-style" layout for better readability.

Contact Section:
This section includes basic contact information like my email and a link to my GitHub profile.
# interactivity:
I ensured the entire layout is responsive, meaning it adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes including mobile devices. I used flexbox and media queries to manage the layout on small screens.

Interactivity was achieved using a small JavaScript function that toggles visibility between sections. Additionally, the profile image dynamically shrinks and moves to the corner when navigating away from the home section, mimicking a floating avatar-like effect.

This task was a great learning experience. I enhanced my understanding of:

Structuring HTML for multi-section single-page apps.

Styling dynamic layouts using only CSS.

Writing simple and clean JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

Ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design from scratch.

# Conclusion

Completing this task not only allowed me to demonstrate my basic front-end skills but also helped me understand how to plan and organize content effectively for a real-world portfolio. It serves as a strong foundation that I can later enhance with JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue, add animation libraries, or integrate contact forms and backend support.

I'm thankful to CodTech for assigning this task â€” it was a perfect opportunity to build something meaningful while learning.
